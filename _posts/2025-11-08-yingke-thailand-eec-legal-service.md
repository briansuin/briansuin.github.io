In Thailand’s **Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC)**, large-scale land transactions often involve multiple legal and regulatory factors — such as investment incentives, foreign ownership limits, industrial land permits, and government approvals.  
With the recent wave of Chinese investment, land values in well-managed industrial parks within the EEC have risen sharply, and premium plots have become strategic assets for manufacturing and supply-chain relocation.  

However, these transactions also carry risks stemming from information gaps, cultural differences, and communication barriers. Even a small oversight may affect regulatory compliance or delay project implementation.  
To mitigate such risks, a **Land Acquisition Due Diligence Report** serves as a critical safeguard — not only reviewing documents but also verifying the project’s compliance through on-site inspection.

This week, the **Yingke Thailand legal-business team** visited an industrial park in **Rayong Province (EEC)** to accompany a northern China–based manufacturing client during negotiations, due diligence, and document verification for a land and facilities acquisition project.  
Such on-site services have become routine for Yingke Thailand over the past three years, reflecting the firm’s long-term commitment to “being present and providing full-process support” for Chinese enterprises investing in Thailand.

The **Land Acquisition Due Diligence Report** covers nine key dimensions, including:  
1. Legality and completeness of land ownership and transfer rights  
2. Existing mortgages, liens, or encumbrances  
3. Legal access and road connections  
4. Government expropriation or reservation risks  
5. Tax compliance and arrears  
6. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) requirements and approval status  
7. Consistency with EEC or industrial park zoning plans  
8. Restrictions under construction or special control zones  
9. Pending disputes or administrative compliance risks  

This framework represents the standard practice of **Yingke (Thailand) Law Firm’s** due-diligence services.  
For Yingke Thailand, legal work goes beyond document review — it means engaging directly on site, addressing complex policy and market realities with clients, and delivering **professional, practical, and actionable** legal solutions rooted in both fact and regulatory logic.
