Leveraging Yingke Law Firm’s global network and collaborative capabilities, the Yingke Shandong Center for Cross-Border Legal Services successfully provided end-to-end legal services for a Chinese listed company’s investment project in Brazil. Launched at the end of 2024, this project marks a key milestone in the company’s global expansion. The Shandong Center integrated domestic and international resources to deliver one-stop legal support — covering market entry, entity establishment, corporate governance, and local operations in Brazil.

During the implementation phase, the Yingke team led the project coordination and company establishment process.  Based on the joint venture agreement, the team completed essential procedures including name approval, articles of association drafting, commercial registration, and foreign investment filing for the Brazilian subsidiary.

At the local construction stage, the Yingke team conducted comprehensive land due diligence and, in line with the company’s industry requirements, handled specialized licenses such as health permits and municipal business licenses, ensuring full regulatory compliance for the factory investment.  In addition, the team provided integrated immigration solutions, including visa applications and long-term residence status conversion for expatriate staff, and assumed responsibility for subsequent accounting and tax agency services.

The project was jointly executed by Yingke teams in Jinan, Shanghai, and Brazil, working in close coordination to deliver a complete legal service package that covered company registration, tax structuring, corporate governance, and plant investment compliance, ensuring the client’s successful expansion into the Brazilian market.
