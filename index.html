    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
Bachelor of Medicine, Shandong First Medical University. With a dual background in law and medicine, I have over eight years of experience in the medical industry and a working knowledge of programming languages including PHP, JavaScript, Go, and Python. 
Before entering the legal profession, I practiced as an ophthalmologist and cardiologist, participating in glaucoma and cataract surgeries, thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, and pacemaker implantation procedures.
</p>
<p>
As a lawyer, I focus on investment and mergers & acquisitions, capital markets, private funds, overseas investment, international trade remedies (anti-dumping, countervailing, and anti-circumvention), and data asset compliance. 
</p>
<p>
Major projects I have participated in include:
<ul>
  <li>M&A transactions for a leading domestic vegetable group and a logistics company</li>
  <li>New Third Board (NEEQ) listings for three Shandong-based companies</li>
  <li>Registration of private fund managers and issuance of private fund products (five fund management firms in mainland China)</li>
  <li>Corporate bond issuance for a Qingdao state-owned investment platform</li>
  <li>Interbank market financing (PPN and MTN) for a leasing company</li>
  <li>Asset securitization (CMBS) for an industrial park in Shandong Province</li>
  <li>Legal counsel to a satellite navigation company, including tidal observation projects in the South Pacific and Atlantic Oceans</li>
  <li>EU anti-circumvention investigation involving a Chinese biodiesel producer</li>
  <li>EU, Mexican, and Thai anti-dumping cases involving two Chinese aluminum-extrusion manufacturers</li>
